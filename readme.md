University Web Design Assignment 

Introduction
This Website was created to fulfill part of my Web Design assignment.  This was my first experience of using
PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and a framework (Codeigniter), and I had to learn all these before progressing.
It was developed on a Windows PC, and my next steps include getting to grips with a Linux system for future web development.
